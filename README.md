# Fitbit-graphs
A simple watch face for Versa and Ionic that shows you 5 indicators as circles completing when a goal is reached.

To see your progress over time those are also shown as a graph with a bar every 30 minutes by default, the frequency can be changed in the settings. The battery level is also visible this way.  Click on the graph to switch display.

This clock face is free and open source: https://github.com/cgueret/fitbit-graphs
